# Door Lock and Motion-Activated Lamp Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates a home entrance security system using Arduino. It combines a password-protected door lock, motion activated porch lighting and an alarm for multiple failed attempts to unlock the door.
When the correct password is entered on the keypad, the servo motor unlocks the door and a light turns on. If the wrong password is entered multiple times, the alarm triggers: LEDs flash and the buzzer sounds. A PIR sensor detects movement near the door, while a photoresistor measures ambient light to control the porch light automatically.

## Features
- Password entry using a 4x4 keypad  
- Servo motor simulating an electronic door lock  
- Light bulb/LED turns on when motion is detected at night
- Alarm system with buzzer and flashing LEDs after 3 failed attempts 
- PIR sensor for motion detection  
- Light detection using photoresistor

## Components
- Arduino Uno board
- PIR motion sensor
- Photoresistor + resistor
- Servo motor (door lock simulation)
- 4x4 keypad
- Piezo buzzer
- 3x LEDs + resistors
- Wires and breadboard
- Light bulb with resistor

## How It Works
1. The system starts in a locked state (servo.write(0)).  
2. The PIR sensor monitors for motion; if detected at night, the light bulb turns on
3. User enters a 3-digit password via the keypad
4. Correct password: servo rotates to unlock door
5. Incorrect password 3 times: alarm triggers â€“ buzzer sounds + LEDs flash
6. Failed attempts counter resets after successful access or after alarm ends.

## Future Improvements
- Add an LCD screen for clearer feedback messages.
- Allow changing the password via the keypad instead of hardcoding it in the program.

## Project Background
This project was for university coursework (Robotics - Homework 1: *Creative Build*).

Assignment goal: "Do something extraordinary" - design a small but non-trivial prototype combining sensors and actuators.
